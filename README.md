# hello-world
A place where I store ideas, resources, or share and discuss things with others

Hi, there!
I'm a UX designer and currently live in Seattle. As Don Norman said, “The new me is beauty.” I enjoy making things neat and fun as well as the process of generating projects from concepts to deliverables.
